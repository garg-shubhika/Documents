In Kubernetes, a pod is the smallest deployable unit that can contain one or more containers. 
When you put two containers in a single pod, they share the same context and resources, which has several important implications:

### Shared Network Namespace
#### Same IP Address: All containers in the same pod share the same IP address. They communicate with each other using localhost.
#### Shared Ports: Containers in the same pod must coordinate their use of network ports to avoid conflicts.

### Shared Storage
#### Volumes: Containers in a pod can share storage volumes. These volumes are mounted into the filesystem of each container, allowing them to share data.

### Shared Lifecycle
#### Co-scheduling: All containers in a pod are scheduled together on the same node.
#### Lifecycle Management: The containers in a pod are managed together. If one container fails, Kubernetes can restart the entire pod.

### Use Cases
#### Sidecar Containers: Often used for scenarios where multiple containers need to work closely together, such as a primary container with a helper container (e.g., log shippers, proxies).
#### Init Containers: Special containers that run before the main containers in a pod, performing setup tasks such as initializing data or configuration.
